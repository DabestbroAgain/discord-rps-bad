This project showcased an experiment with interactive images in Discord.

Discord has an undocumented s/e/d style shortcut which can be used in the (desktop only) chat box to edit your last message with find/replace.

The rock paper scissors game would be played by copying the github image link (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DabestbroAgain/discord-rps-bad/main/move.png) to discord, then following the instructions on discord to move through a series of pregenerated images in this repository.

Very rudimentary, and not an original idea by me. Inspired by the interactive chess stuff that was circulating at the time.
